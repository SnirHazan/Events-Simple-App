# Events-Simple-App
Simple Web Application based on React, NodeJs, GraphQL and MongoDB.

The app enable everybody to see the existent Events,but only auth user can create a new event(with some details, like date, description..), 
or to book to event of other auth users.

The goal of this app is to learn how to use GraphQL in the right way,
What are the components in GraphQL(Resolvers,Schemas etc'), and how all that staf get connected to Nodejs and some DB
(in this case - MongoDB).

Enjoy :)
